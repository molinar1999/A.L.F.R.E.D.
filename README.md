# Meet ALFRED.

I have a lot of apps that I use that assist me in my everyday operations. The various functions that these tasks assist me with is regulating my circadian rhythm, my routines, my task completion, my food tracking, workout tracking, and energy tracking. ALFRED is going to be the culmination of all of these app's functionality. And the best part? No more subscriptions, and I get to keep all of the data for analysis.






# What does ALFRED stand for?
